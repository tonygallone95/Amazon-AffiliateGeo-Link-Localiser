# Amazon-AffiliateGeo-Link-Localiser
A simple but effective link localizer for Amazon Affiliates.

Overview: This Link Localiser has been built to automatically redirect users to the correct Amazon locale, for example; If you're linking directly to a product on Amazon.co.uk, a user from Canada will also land on Amazon UK and most likely not make a purchase due to overseas shipping.
